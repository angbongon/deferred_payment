# How To - Project Documentation

## Get Started

Documentation can be written as md (markdown) files in `deferred_payment/docs`.


To build and serve docs, use the commands:
```bash 
$ docker-compose -f local.yml up docs
```
Changes to files in `docs` will be picked up and reloaded automatically.

`MkDocs <https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/>` is the tool used to build documentation.
